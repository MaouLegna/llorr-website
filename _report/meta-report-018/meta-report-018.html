<h1 id="regions">Regions</h1>
<h2 id="gini-index">Gini Index</h2>
<p>I decided to add an additional information to help interpret the state of the Regions’ Play Rates: the Gini Index.</p>
<p>The Gini Index is a measure of heterogeneity so, in this case and in simpler terms, how much the play rates are similar. The Index goes (when normalized like here) <span class="math inline">\(in\)</span> [0,1] and it’s equal to 1 when there’s a single value with 100% play rate or 0 when all play rates are equal. Of course a Gini Index of 1 needs to be avoided but it’s not like the aim should be 0. As said, it’s just to add some additional tools.</p>
<p>Also, the HHI is used by <a href="https://twitter.com/drlor4/">Dr.LoR</a> is just another way to measure the Gini Index. So let’s also add some reproducibility / comparable numbers.</p>
<p>Before showing this weeks results I thought it would be better to have a generalized idea of past data. The following plot display the Gini Index over the latest 17 weeks for region frequencies by inclusion rate.</p>

<p>Top Win rates of the top10 best performing least played combination of champions. Play rate <span class="math inline">\(\in\)</span> [0.1%,1%)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Since I added the server-specific values it would have been wrong to ignore this also in this ‘Underdog’ section. I decided to leave the rule untouched, without taking in account the different servers. While for the “Meta Decks” it was more a natural expansion, here the results can widely differ by small changed and as mentioned in the past I would like to leave the current rule as much as possible unless it’s too broken. Of course one could complain as there decks whose results are mostly carried by a single server and in the other that decks is almost not even played. All true, but there are limitation like the facrs that the asian server is very low on number during all the season so even the condition of a mininum of 50 games with playrate <span class="math inline">\(\in\)</span> [0.1%,1%) is a lot screw the results. Also this section in not as the Meta Deck one where players are interested in seeing the performance of the most played decks but it’s meant to be a “look around there may be some dark tech that’s worth investing some time”.</p>
<p>A better solution would be ‘expanding’ this section or providing some tools to allows players to search the result. But there’s a problem, not providing immediate readable results and leave the research to the user is a bad choice in a report from my point of view at least and for sections like this one in particular. It could be worth exploring as a standalone option like the recently uploaded page for the MU table (<a href="https://llorr-stats.netlify.app/mu/">MU-Table</a>)</p>

<p>Looking at this week results it’s clear most of these decks can be grouped as ‘Plunder’ decks. I’m working on it, but I’m still far from reaching a quality of the results that satisfy me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The LMI <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is an Index I developed to measure the performance of decks in the metagame. For those who are familiar with basic statistical concept I wrote a document to explain the theory behind it: , it’s very similar to <a href="https://www.vicioussyndicate.com">vicioussyndicate</a> (vS) Meta Score from their data reaper report. The score of each deck <strong><em>is not</em></strong> just their “strength”, it takes in consideration both play rates and win rates that’s why I prefer to say it measure the “performance”. The values range from 0 to 100 and the higher the value, the higher is the performance.</p>
