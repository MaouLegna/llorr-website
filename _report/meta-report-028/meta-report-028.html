<p>Insert <em>Dead Game Memes</em> here. With the previous season too we had a huge drop in the last weak before the new ranked season/set, no reasons to be a dog who barks at the shadows.</p>
<p>Last Update: 2021-10-17 15:42</p>
<p><span style="     color: red !important;">Note :</span> following my recent analysis the following decks:</p>

<li><p>Sivir / Zed</p></li>
<li><p>Akshan / Sivir / Zed</p></li>

<p>Have been aggregated into a single archetype: “ASZ - Sivir Ionia”</p>
<p>In addition a quick fix to account for the Rubin-baits (burn decks that pretend to be other archetypes) decks have been applied and they are called:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>RubinBait - Draven / Ezreal</p></li>
<li><p>RubinBait - Draven / Sion</p></li>
<li><p>RubinBait - Caitlyn / Draven - not make from Rubin but same logic</p></li>

<p>The Gini Index is a measure of heterogeneity so, in this case and in simpler terms, how much the play rates are similar. The Index goes (when normalized like here) <span class="math inline">\(in\)</span> [0,1] and it’s equal to 1 when there’s a single value with 100% play rate or 0 when all play rates are equal. Of course a Gini Index of 1 needs to be avoided but it’s not like the aim should be 0. As said, it’s just to add some additional tools.</p>

<p><span style="     color: red !important;">Note :</span> Regarding MU, this is not the most accurate estimation you can get from my data. If you want a better picture of the current meta it would be better to look at the dedicated MU-page where I use all “Ranked” games with the current sets of buffs and nerfs. While one may object I don’t account for optimizations and differences in skills acquired during the weeks, the overall number of games / sample size makes them a better source of information. So, in case, pls refer to the <a href="https://www.llorr-stats.com/static/mu.html">MU - page</a> for a better “meta-investigation”.</p>

For those who are familiar with basic statistical concept I wrote a document to explain the theory behind it: , it’s very similar to <a href="https://www.vicioussyndicate.com">vicioussyndicate</a> (vS) Meta Score from their data reaper report. The score of each deck <strong><em>is not</em></strong> just their “strength”, it takes in consideration both play rates and win rates that’s why I prefer to say it measure the “performance”. The values range from 0 to 100 and the higher the value, the higher is the performance.</p>
