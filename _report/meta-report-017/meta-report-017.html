<p>In this section I provide the play rate of which combinations of champions (plus the regions) are used in a deck. The champions showed right before a game starts for example. Right now it’s a simple approximation of the archetypes played in the ladder as such information is not restrictive enough.</p>

<p>How to read the table: <br> - Play rate: How often a card is included in this class of decks / the table is order by this column. <br> - 3/2/1 is the relative and absolute frequency of the number of copies in the decks that plays them <br> - Frequencies from 50% to 100% are colored from shades of green to white to identify more easily the highest values</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The LMI <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is an Index I developed to measure the performance of decks in the metagame. For those who are familiar with basic statistical concept I wrote a document to explain the theory behind it: , it’s very similar to <a href="https://www.vicioussyndicate.com">vicioussyndicate</a> (vS) Meta Score from their data reaper report. The score of each deck <strong><em>is not</em></strong> just their “strength”, it takes in consideration both play rates and win rates that’s why I prefer to say it measure the “performance”. The values range from 0 to 100 and the higher the value, the higher is the performance.</p>
