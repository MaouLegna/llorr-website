Update 2023-06:

Regarding the new patch and season everything should return by the **1st of July**.

( Can't do it already the day before because of timing with other issues )

Update 2023-05:

Ops, a few days ago, I occidentally deleted all the Master data from this season ( Patch 4.3 )

As the Master data is the main content and necessary to create the Diamond data I have to hold on up until next patch

Sorry

Legna
