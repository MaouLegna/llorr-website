Regarding the Bo3-Helper, as it requires a server to work and the one I'm using have limited of available hrs it may not be always up. To solve this I would need to pay for a server and yeah it may be a problem... in case if I have enough support...I can invest on it. There's a buymeacofee (~patreon) link in the menu if one wants to help me.
