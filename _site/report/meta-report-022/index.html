<p>The Gini Index is a measure of heterogeneity so, in this case and in simpler terms, how much the play rates are similar. The Index goes (when normalized like here) <span class="math inline">\(in\)</span> [0,1] and it’s equal to 1 when there’s a single value with 100% play rate or 0 when all play rates are equal. Of course a Gini Index of 1 needs to be avoided but it’s not like the aim should be 0. As said, it’s just to add some additional tools.</p>

<p>Looking at this week results it’s clear most of these decks can be grouped as ‘Plunder’ decks. I’m working on it, but I’m still far from reaching a quality of the results that satisfy me.</p>

<p>Usually I don’t take a meta-deck for this section, but the underdog decks are either “old decks” or with just too few games. So, with EUM getting near I choose something that’s quite on the rise in EU: Nami / Zoe, even if it’s exactly the server where it seems to perform better (hard to say without a interval estimate)</p>

<p>How to read the table: <br> - Play rate: How often a card is included in this class of decks / the table is order by this column. <br> - 3/2/1 is the relative and absolute frequency of the number of copies in the decks that plays them <br> - Frequencies from 50% to 100% are colored from shades of green to white to identify more easily the highest values</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The LMI <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> is an Index I developed to measure the performance of decks in the metagame. For those who are familiar with basic statistical concept I wrote a document to explain the theory behind it: , it’s very similar to <a href="https://www.vicioussyndicate.com">vicioussyndicate</a> (vS) Meta Score from their data reaper report. The score of each deck <strong><em>is not</em></strong> just their “strength”, it takes in consideration both play rates and win rates that’s why I prefer to say it measure the “performance”. The values range from 0 to 100 and the higher the value, the higher is the performance.</p>
