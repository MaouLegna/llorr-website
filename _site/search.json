      "description": "Important: There is global problem regarding the Riot-API (also affecting LoL) where it's not possible to collect most (almost all) recent games. In the case of all Masters players there is just no new games that's updated after a certain threshold. While I can currently search at random for some games just to have some current-patch values, it wouldn't a representation of the Master ladder which is my core popular. Heck, I wouldn't even be able to tell what I'm actually analyzing and this would be wrong on so many levels. So, sorry if I can provide data as I would, once there are updates I'll update (and tweet) as soon as possible\n",
